BitSeeds (BITS) v  0.7.0.1
===========================

Intro
---------------------------

BitSeeds provides a cryptographic ledger with unique features specifically designed for not-for-profit organizations and driving merchant adoption.  Ecosystem development is an ongoing process spearheaded by the BitSeeds Foundation.

BitSeeds is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient SHA-256 based crypto-currency. Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, PPCoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake help further advance the field of crypto-currency.

Why Is BitSeeds Necessary?
---------------------------

BitSeeds adds ecosystem-specific remittance rails for charitable donations and a blockchain robust enough to accomodate future development.  Every commercial transaction conducted within the remittance rail has the value added benefit of a charitable tax deduction, beyond the normal cost savings of crypto-currency adoption.  Individuals are then incentivized to hold and stake BitSeeds in personal wallets not simply to support the network, but support the greater mission of the Rainforest Foundation to reforest the planet.  

> **"The simple act of holding BitSeeds makes the world a better place because you are investing in the mission of the Rainforest Foundation to reforest the planet."**

The BitSeeds Foundation
---------------------------

The BitSeeds Foundation is a not-for-profit entity registered in the state of Nevada.

More information may be found at [the BitSeeds website](http://BitSeeds.org).

The BitSeeds Custody Address
---------------------------

The custody amount of 100,000,000 BITS was generated in Block 1 and shall be staked for seven days to form a core of funds to kickstart the BitSeeds Foundation.  The custody amount is to be held in a 3-of-4 multisig wallet (BhHpy32LSFgpqNp8ZUpq1dvyJYkuG83JTW) generated with the following public keys:

The custody amound shall not be spent, but shall be staked no more frequently than a quaterly basis after the initial seven days following launch.  Interest generated will be directly reinvested into development of the BitSeeds ecosystem by incentivizing participants and vendors to accept BitSeeds for the automatic charitable tax deduction (see below).  The interest paid on the first seven days shall be held and staked by the BitSeeds Foundation as a means of thanking donors for supporting our mission and that of the Rainforest Foundation.

Tax Deductions for Merchant Adoption
---------------------------

Merchant adoption is driven through a custom remittance system being developed by [Coin.co](http://coin.co).

1.25% of every transaction processed is sent to the BitSeeds Custody Address.  Merchants will be presented with a yearly accounting and requisite paperwork for tax purposes.

**Every transaction completed through this process is a charitable tax deduction for the accepting merchant.**

Development process
---------------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
stable release versions of BitSeeds.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will
be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days
after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed
in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after
15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be 
labeled 'stale'.
